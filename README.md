# Weather_API_Data
This project visualizes the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using python and the OpenWeatherMap API. Creates plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude, and computes linear regression relationships (VacationPy.ipynb). Uses Geoapify API and geoViews Python library to filter specified weather conditions and generate a vizualization to locate hotels within range of ideal weather (VacationPy.ipynb).
